# Prices Prediction System

A machine learning-based system for predicting prices of commodities/products using historical data and statistical analysis. This project is built to support better decision-making in domains like retail pricing, stock forecasting, and real estate valuation.

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 **PDF-based data loading** using Langchain and PyPDFLoader
- 📊 **Data inspection and preprocessing** modules (missing values, summary statistics)
- 🔍 **Univariate and multivariate analysis**
- 🤖 **Machine Learning models** for regression-based price prediction
- 📈 **Visual insights and performance evaluation**

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonalee88/prices-predictorSystem.git
cd prices-predictorSystem
```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
conda create -n price-predictor python=3.10
conda activate price-predictor
```
3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 📌 How to Use
